**ABSTRACT**

Crewed space habitat construction is a multidisciplinary endeavor that involves complex interactions among various technologies. This complexity necessitates robust R&D strategies informed by a thorough analysis of the relationships between these technologies. However, traditional qualitative approaches and hierarchical classification methods have struggled to capture the deep semantic relationships and many-to-many interdependencies among technologies. This study addresses these limitations by integrating SBERT (Sentence-BERT)-based semantic similarity measurement with network science techniques. We conducted a quantitative analysis to measure the semantic similarities among 87 technologies related to crewed space habitat construction and organized their relationships into a network format. Through this analysis, we identified clusters of functionally related technologies and key technologies that exhibit high centrality within the network. The findings from this quantitative relationship analysis provide a foundation for future technology roadmap design and help identify potential areas for interdisciplinary research.
